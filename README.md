### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcos Alvarez, a passionate web developer in constant evolution. My journey in the world of development is fueled by my tireless perseverance and a steadfast commitment to taking each project to its full potential.

## About Me

ðŸ’» I recently completed an exciting web development bootcamp at IronHack, where I honed my skills in React, Node, Express, Mongoose, and Handlebars. Every line of code I write is an expression of my dedication to technical mastery and the creation of impactful solutions.

ðŸš€ My philosophy is simple: there's no challenge too big, and no project too ambitious. My persistence in problem-solving and my love for continuous learning form the foundation of my career.

Since I can remember, I've always felt a deep curiosity about the inner workings of computers. Although my career began in different sectors, my passion for technology never diminished. It all started with informal experiments and testing with computers while working in other fields.

My professional path took a significant turn when I started working in a computer store as a mobile phone technician. Despite not having formal training at the time, my enthusiasm and dedication allowed me to excel in repairing mobile phones, laptops, and other electronic devices.

The true turning point came when I met someone who saw my potential and encouraged me to pursue further education. With their support, I decided to embark on a career change and reinvent myself professionally. I began studying intensively, more than ever before, with the goal of making my dream a reality.

Currently, I am focused on my studies to become a web developer, a field I am deeply passionate about. Today, I am proud of the progress I have made. Although I am aware that I still have a long way to go, I am determined to keep moving forward. My passion for technology and programming is my greatest motivation, and nothing will stop me on this exciting journey.

**ðŸ”œ Excited to announce that I will soon be studying at 42 MÃ¡laga, taking my development skills to the next level!**

## Development Philosophy

I approach every line of code with the conviction that every error is an opportunity for learning, and every success is a step towards excellence. I don't settle for the ordinary; I always seek ways to improve and surpass my own limits.
